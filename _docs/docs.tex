\section{Introduction}

Tape diagrams are a diagrammatic language for rig categories with finite biproducts. These can be intuitively thought as \emph{string diagrams within string diagrams}. These have been used to provide an axiomatization of the positive fragment of Tarski's Calculus of Relations, and can be extended with notions such as traces to provide a \emph{diagrammatic algebra for program logics}. In this document, we present a tool that allows the description, manipulation and automated depiction of tape diagrams.

\section{The tool}
The tool consists of a \emph{description language}, which allows the user to define and manipulate terms, a \emph{typechecking module}, which checks whether the given terms are well-typed,  a \emph{drawing module}, which produces a \LaTeX \;(TikZ) picture of the diagrams, and a \emph{rewriting module}, which {\color{red} does not exist yet}. The tool is written in OCaml, using the Menhir library for generating the parser of the language.
